        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>I have worked in the media industry for over 17 years. I am an experienced and reliable video editor and producer who has a particular eye for detail. I have worked around the world in many different environments. If the job needs to be done, then I get it
          done. I pride myself on not missing deadlines and work at a fast pace. I am a team player and can work unsupervised quiet happily. I have experience in camera operating both moving and still footage. I have recently finished a bootcamp in Web developing and design through Yoobee Design School.
          Some of the platforms learnt were HTML, CSS, Wordpress, Woocommerce, Javascript and React. I have decided to branch into the digital media world to upskill and bring my video and production skills to the web. I thrive on new challenges. I love being creative and I am not averse to consructive criticism, to create the best product possible.</p>
